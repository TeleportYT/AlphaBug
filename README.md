# Story  
A programmer creates a game and you are the main character of the game, but the game is in alpha test and it has some bugs which you as a player need to defeat to help the programmer.
sometimes you kill them, sometimes you need to fix the code when you get to the terminal, and at some point in the game, the player finds a cute little bug that doesn't want to die and the player becomes a friend with him but at the end, the cute little bug actually stored so much bug time and became a mega bug boss which eventually player needs to kill and decode it before the game releases
